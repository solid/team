# Converting SolidProject.org to RDF

## Responsibilities

SolidProject.org currently uses Jekyl and Github. We want to create an RDF-based site so that we're dogfooding our own technology. Perhaps the best change would be creating one, RDF-based source of truth for information like Solid Team members, and apps listed on the apps page. We would also want to establish a technical process for people to propose new information to pages and for the Solid team to review it.

Note: this change would not affect the hosting of the Solid Specification on github, unless spec members wanted it to.
