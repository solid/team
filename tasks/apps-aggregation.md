# Manage list of Solid apps and tools

## Responsibilities

The task force is responsible for curating and maintaining a list of Solid applications and tools.

The list is made publicly accessible on the [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/) website.

Curation and maintenance of the list is based on the [inclusion and exclusion criteria](https://solidproject.org/apps#app-inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria). The task force is also responsible for processing proposed changes to the criteria.

Requesting an update to the list is recorded through a GitHub Pull Request on the [solid/solidproject.org](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/pulls) repository.
