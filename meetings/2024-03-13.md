## Topics

There wasn't really a meeting, since so few met up. But the four that did show up agreed that the website can be
launched as soon as the events are done.

Arne asked about what the plans are for having a list of Solid-compatible apps at the webpage, since it's not in the
new redesign. He was the told the history of the choice of removing this list, basically that the team don't have
resources to do so at the moment. Arne will create a task for the work to aggregate a list of Solid-compatible apps, in
case others want to join and help with the work.
