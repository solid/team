# Solid Team

The Solid Team, headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, provides an organisational umbrella for facilitating a strong open source community in support of Solid. This repository contains work of the Solid Team to meet the needs of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The Solid Team is a group of volunteers tasked with representing the Solid Project in an official capacity. It engages in activities that foster the spread and adoption of the Solid protocol.

## Participation

All substantive contributors must be members of the Solid Team. It’s easy to [join the Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/process) if you’d like to contribute with any role.

The Solid Team has a (member-only) [chat](https://gitter.im/solid/team).

The Solid Team holds meetings at <https://meet.jit.si/solid-team> on every second Wednesday of the month at 15:00 UTC - subscribe to [vCalendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/team/main/meetings/calendar.ics). Meetings are transcribed and [published](https://github.com/solid/team/tree/main/meetings/). Additional team meetings may be created, in which case Solid Team members will be notified via calendar invitation and in the Solid Team chat.

To know more about how to contribute, check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/solid/team/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
