# Solid Team

The Solid Team, headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, provides an organisational umbrella for facilitating a strong open source community in support of Solid. This repository contains work of the Solid Team to meet the needs of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The Solid Team is a group of volunteers tasked with representing the Solid Project in an official capacity. It engages in activities that foster the spread and adoption of the Solid protocol.

## Participation

All substantive contributors must be members of the Solid Team. It’s easy to [join the Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/process) if you’d like to contribute with any role.

The Solid Team has a (member-only) [chat](https://gitter.im/solid/team).

The Solid Team holds meetings at <https://meet.jit.si/solid-team> on every second Wednesday of the month at 15:00 UTC. Meetings are transcribed and [published](https://github.com/solid/team/tree/main/meetings/). Additional team meetings may be created, in which case Solid Team members will be notified via calendar invitation and in the Solid Team chat.
