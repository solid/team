# Solid Team

The Solid Team, headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, provides an organisational umbrella for facilitating a strong open source community in support of Solid. This repository contains work of the Solid Team to meet the needs of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The Solid Team is a group of volunteers tasked with representing the Solid Project in an official capacity. It engages in activities that foster the spread and adoption of the Solid protocol.

## Participation

All substantive contributors must be members of the Solid Team. It’s easy to [join the Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/team/blob/main/team.md) if you’d like to contribute with any role.

The Solid Team has a (member-only) [chat](https://gitter.im/solid/team).

The Solid Team holds meetings at <https://meet.jit.si/solid-team> on every second Wednesday of the month at 15:00 UTC - subscribe to [vCalendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solid/team/main/meetings/calendar.ics). Meetings are transcribed and [published](https://github.com/solid/team/tree/main/meetings/). Additional team meetings may be created, in which case Solid Team members will be notified via calendar invitation and in the Solid Team chat.

## Membership

[Membership Information](/team.md)

## Decisions

Strategic, tactical, and policy decisions are made based on [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making).

Routine and operational decisions are made in the context of [Task Forces](https://github.com/solid/team/blob/main/README.md#tasks) by their members in coordination with the Task Force Lead.

When faced with unresolved strong objections in decision-making processes based on consensus, another mechanism may be employed to reach a conclusive outcome. This involves establishing a decision rule for each particular issue, where a majority is defined to have a specific threshold, and subsequently conducting a vote. This approach is loosely based on the W3C's guidelines for deciding by vote, as [outlined in the W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20231103/#decisions). A vote should only be conducted after all attempts at consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed. It is important to note that, in this context, a Member or group of related Members is considered a single organization, aligning with the W3C's principles.

## Code of Conduct

The Solid Team follows the [Solid Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)

## Tasks

The Solid Team engages in a number of tasks. Tasks may be added or removed from the team's scope by majority vote at a Solid Team meeting. A blocked task is a tast that the team wants to do, but currently doesn't have the resources to do.

### Task Force Membership

Team members may be added or removed from a Task Force by a majority vote at a Solid Team meeting. There must be a lead for each Task Force. While other members may assist in the task, it is the responsibility of the lead to report on task progress to the Solid Team, to collaborate with the Team, and to ensure that all selection processes are transparent and foster diversity.
