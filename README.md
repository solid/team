# Solid Team

The Solid Team, headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, provides an organisational umbrella for facilitating a strong open source community in support of Solid. This repository contains work of the Solid Team to meet the needs of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The Solid Team is a group of volunteers tasked with representing the Solid Project in an official capacity. It engages in activities that foster the spread and adoption of the Solid protocol.

## Participation

All substantive contributors must be members of the Solid Team. It’s easy to [join the Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/process) if you’d like to contribute with any role.

The Solid Team has a (member-only) [chat](https://gitter.im/solid/team).

The Solid Team holds meetings at <https://meet.jit.si/solid-team> on every second Wednesday of the month at 15:00 UTC. Meetings are transcribed and [published](https://github.com/solid/team/tree/main/meetings/). Additional team meetings may be created, in which case Solid Team members will be notified via calendar invitation and in the Solid Team chat.

## Decisions

Strategic, tactical and policy decisions are made based on [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making).

Routine and operational decisions are made in the context of [Task Forces](https://github.com/solid/team/blob/main/README.md#tasks) by their members in coordination with the Task Force Lead.

When faced with unresolved strong objections in decision-making processes based on consensus, a mechanism may be employed to reach a conclusive outcome. This involves establishing a decision rule for each particular issue, where a majority is defined with a specific threshold, and subsequently conducting a vote. This approach is loosely based on the W3C's guidelines for deciding by vote, as [outlined in the W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2023/Process-20231103/#decisions). A vote should only be conducted after all attempts at consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed. It is important to note that, in this context, a Member or group of related Members is considered a single organization, aligning with the W3C's principles.

## Code of Conduct

The Solid Team follows the [Solid Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)

## Tasks

The Solid Team engages in a number of tasks. Tasks may be added or removed from the team's scope by majority vote at a Solid Team meeting. A blocked task is a tast that the team wants to do, but currently doesn't have the resources to do.

### Task Force Membership
